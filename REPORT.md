- merge method of pandas does not work well
- using csv file as file storage in /data so I dont use SQlite
- summary graph has both average and total comsumption because we can get same insight from total or average
- apexchart,which is rappar of chart.js, does not match due to long loading time
- user_table can group by area
- when click user_id in user_table, link to detail view 
- zooming graph
- delete average graph due to heavy zooming
- zoom in graph is too heavy
- user_table can group by area
